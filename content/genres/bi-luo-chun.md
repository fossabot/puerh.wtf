description: >-
  A highly sought-after Chinese green made from incredibly young pickings (one
  bud, one leaf). One of the earliest picked greens of the Spring, when it's
  still quite chilly out. The buds are typically are covered in fuzz, which
  isn't to be mistaken for mold.


  After picking, the leaves are withered for a relatively short amount of time before being wok-fried to deactivate the oxidation process and retain the material's lovely green coloring. Initial wok temperatures are high, then mellow out while the leaves are hand-rolled into their signature curled appearance. Once the batch is uniformly rolled, the wok is brought to a higher heat again to fry most of the remaining moisture out. The material is then stored in an environment that will pull residual moisture out of the leaves to ensure the flavor is fixed and no unintentional fermentation occurs.


  This variant of tea is often much more complex in flavor + aroma than other Chinese greens.
